# Heuristics
<p> Often in early academics, we will typically find a solution to a problem using either careful consideration to discover an underlying pattern or formula, or to brute-force a solution. However, we will eventually run into a set of problems where both approaches seem to be unfeasible. Algorithms which will take a considerable amount of time to brute force or find a solution to with typical means are often called intractible. Hence, a different approach is required. </p>

<p> To put simply, we will need to use heuristic algorithms - algorithms that give a satisfactory estimate within a reasonable amount of time. Below, we will outline different heuristic approaches to solve different problems, and their possible benefits and drawbacks. </p>
